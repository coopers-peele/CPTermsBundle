CPTermsBundle - General concepts
=============

Terms of service - Definition
-----------------------------

The **Terms of service** (also known as Conditions of use) are a document specifying the respective obligations of both you (as the publisher/provider of a web site or software application) and the users (of this web site or application).

Your terms of service will usually be drafted by your legal advisor, although there is nothing to prevent you from doing it yourself, if (and that is admittedly a big if) you know what you are doing.

The format of the terms of service is entirely free. However, for the convenience of readers, the current practice is to organize them in sections and sub-sections, each section having a title that indicates the topic it discusses.

The CPTermsBundle's [administration pages](Resources/doc/admin.md) provide you with the means to input your terms of service for later use throughtout your web site, and organize them in sections and sub-sections.

Draft vs finalized terms of service
-----------------------------------

Whether you are doing this on your own or through your legal advisor, the drafting of your terms of service is likely to require some degree of back-and-forth discussion. You need to strike the right balance between adequate protection for you, and some degree of fairness for your customers. During that time, obviously, the draft terms may not be seen by the users.

At some point, you will decide that you have a final version of your terms which are ready to be published on your website for your users to see. Of course, once published, your terms should not be changed any more, and certainly not if you've already recorded some users' agreement to them. Since the terms represent your mutual obligations with the user, you cannot modify them unilaterally. (Of course, you can publish a revised version of your terms, but you will need to obtain a renewed agreement from your users. This topic is covered later.)

CPTermsBundle lets you edit your draft terms of service; while in draft form, the terms are not visible to the users of your web site. When ready, you can __finalize__ your terms; this marks them as ready to be published on your web site and become visible to your users; finalized terms cannot be modified anymore.

Current or latest terms of service
----------------------------------

At any point in time, you can only have 1 version of your terms of service in force. This is referred to as the "current" or "latest" terms of service.

For the CPTermsBundle, the latest terms are the terms that were finalized the latest in time. NOn-finalized terms (i.e. in draft form) are never considered to be the latest terms. If you have several terms that are finalized, the terms that were finalized last will be considered to be the latest terms.

Multiple versions
-----------------

Your terms of service are likely to evolve over time, whether because of evolving legislation or regulation, or because of advice from your legel advisor, or simply because the services you offer have changed.

As we have seen earlier, once published, and more importantly once agreed to by a user, your terms cannot be changed, except by publishing a new version of the terms, clearly identified as such, and requesting users to agree to this new, revised, version.

Obtaining user agreement
------------------------

Typically, you will require your users to agree to your terms of service before allowing them to use your web site, or portions of it. 

The most efficient way to obtain your user's agreement is during the registration or signup process.

However there are several scenarios where you will need to obtain the agreement of a user who is already registered, such as:

* you have published a revised version of your terms of service, and need to obtain the renewed agreement of the user
* you previously had no terms of service and are intrudocing them to an app that already has registered users
* for some reason, you have not recorded the agreement of some registered users
